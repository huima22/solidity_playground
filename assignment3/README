ABC Rental Company has decided to use blockchain for its car renting business.  ABC is engaging you to write a smart contract using Solidity to engage with its customers.  Using the smart contract, a customer can choose a particular car from the range of cars ABC has, and check the car's availability.  If available, the customer uses the smart contract to rent and pay ABC Company.  After the rental, the customer uses the smart contract to return the car back to ABC Company.   The company can then release the car for other customers to rent.  If a car is returned with damages, the company will ask the customer to pay for the damages.
